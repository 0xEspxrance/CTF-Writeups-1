An image was posted on Twitter.

The image contains two nested barcodes.

The *QR code* can be analyzed simply cutting the code portion and analyzing it.

Decoding it will give the following.

```
137:64:137:154:171:146:63:175
```

Decoding from octal representation to ASCII will give the following.

```
_4_lyf3}
```

Then you have to cut the *Aztec code* from the global one.

Decoding it will give the following.

```
414f54577b6234726330643373
```

Decoding from hexadecimal representation to ASCII will give the following.

```
AOTW{b4rc0d3s
```

Putting everything together will give you the flag.

```
AOTW{b4rc0d3s_4_lyf3}
```
