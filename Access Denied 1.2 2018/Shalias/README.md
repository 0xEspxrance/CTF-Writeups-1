## Solution

The `flag.txt` file is in the home diractory of the user, but the `cat` command seems to not work.

Analyzing the `/bin/` directory will reveal that the `cat` command exists, hopefully.

```
user@78718481b4f8:~$ ls /bin/
```

It can be used to print the flag.

```
user@78718481b4f8:~$ /bin/cat flag.txt
accessdenied{un4li4sing_w4s_34sy_5994asd}
```
