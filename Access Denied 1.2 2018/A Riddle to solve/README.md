## Solution

The quote is from William Shakespeare's *Julius Caesar*, so the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) must be involved.

The content of the downloaded file is the following:

```
tvvxllwxgbxw{pX_TkX_UX_VHeExZx_tlwpYP}
```

Considering that the first letter must be an `a`, due to flag syntax, the rotation should be of 7 places (i.e. ROT7).

An [on-line service](https://www.rot13.com/) can be used to obtain the flag:
