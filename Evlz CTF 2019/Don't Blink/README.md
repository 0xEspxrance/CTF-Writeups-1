# Evlz CTF 2019 â€“ Don't Blink

## Challenge

> Do you have persistence of vision? Well try it out with this file

## Solution

The file is a GIF image which shows several frames containg parts of the final flag.

![persistant.gif](persistant.gif)

The GIF must be split (e.g. using [https://ezgif.com/split](https://ezgif.com/split)) and then each frame must be merged in the same final image, ignoring white background.

The merge operation can be performed via script or using an image manipulation program (*MS Paint* can be fine).

The final image will be:

![flag.png](flag.png)

Hence, the flag is:
