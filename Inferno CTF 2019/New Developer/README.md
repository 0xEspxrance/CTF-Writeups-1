## Solution

Analyzing the commits of one of its projects on Github, you can find the following.

```
https://github.com/iamthedeveloper123/bash2048/commit/f6008f3d67829ad0ab19d029eec6833a196db8d8
```

It contains an interesting change.

```bash
printf "\nYou have lost, try going to https://pastebin.com/$CODE for help!.  (And also for some secrets...) \033[0m\n"
```

The content of the environment variable `$CODE` can be found inside a dot file.

```
https://github.com/iamthedeveloper123/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc2#L83
```

The value is the following.

```bash
export CODE="trpNwEPT"
```

So connecting to `https://pastebin.com/trpNwEPT` will give you the flag.
