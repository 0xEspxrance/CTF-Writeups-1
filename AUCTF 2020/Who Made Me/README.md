## Solution

* is `https://github.com/auehc`.

One of the members is `https://github.com/vincentchu37` and he has an interesting repository: `https://github.com/vincentchu37/AUCTF-2020`.

That repository was created by `https://github.com/chharles`, the author of the challenge.

Analyzing the commits, one regarding the flag can be found (`https://github.com/chharles/AUCTF-2020/commit/23ba3a6fbc0ef5244af488c87022ad27a9d10e06`), but the reported flag is a false one (`soGJvcjTknXM`).
